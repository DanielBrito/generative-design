# Processing

Processing relates software concepts to principles of visual form, motion, and interaction. It integrates a programming language, development environment, and teaching methodology into a unified system. 

Processing was created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context, to serve as a software sketchbook, and to be used as a production tool. Students, artists, design professionals, and researchers use it for learning, prototyping, and production.

The Processing language is a text programming language specifically designed to generate and modify images. Processing strives to achieve a balance between clarity and advanced features. Beginners can write their own programs after only a few minutes of instruction, but more advanced users can employ and write libraries with additional functions. The system facilitates teaching many computer graphics and interaction techniques including vector/raster drawing, image processing, color models, mouse and keyboard events, network communication, and object-oriented programming. Libraries easily extend Processingâ€™s ability to generate sound, send/receive data in diverse formats, and to import/export 2D and 3D file formats.
