## 🕒 [As Linguagens de Programação para as Artes - Metodologias de Ensino-Aprendizagem Adaptadas (Madalena Ribeiro)](./Files/as_linguagens_de_programacao_para_as_artes__madalena_ribeiro.pdf)

_Resumo: Atualmente, as linguagens de programação são usadas por pessoas com formação em domínios cada vez mais diversos e distintos do habitual, tendo já chegado ao domínio das artes. A linguagem Processing, que tem um cariz visual e que possibilita o desenvolvimento de aplicações/performances com elementos visuais e sonoros, foi mesmo projetada para ser usada por artistas. Contudo, a preparação prévia e a sensibilidade do público-alvo desta linguagem, enquanto aprendizes, é bastante distinta da preparação dos alunos comuns de linguagem de programação. Por esse motivo, é aqui proposto um conjunto de metodologias de ensino/aprendizagem adaptadas, no sentido de criar entusiasmo na aprendizagem e atingir um êxito efetivo._

## 🕒 [Contextualizing Generative Design](./Files/contextualizing_generative_design__saeed_arida.pdf) (Saeed Arida)

_Abstract: Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch? How can we address contextual parameters without a loss?_

## 🕒 [Design Generativo - Estudo exploratório sobre o uso de programação no design](./Files/design_generativo_estudo_sobre_o_uso_de_programacao_no_design__anderson_vieira.pdf) (Anderson Vieira)

_Resumo: Atualmente, o uso de novas tecnologias influencia diretamente o processo de criação do designer. A programação é uma destas ferramentas e vem sendo utilizada, por exemplo, em aplicações do design que tem sido chamadas de Design Paramétrico e Design Generativo. Assim sendo, o objetivo desse trabalho é realizar um estudo exploratório sobre a influência da programação no processo de design e em sua linguagem visual. Para atingir esse objetivo, foi levantado um histórico desta prática, traçado um panorama de projetos da atualidade e foram realizadas experimentações práticas que exploraram as possibilidades e potencialidades deste modo de fazer design na área visual. Estas explorações revelaram pontos importantes do processo de design que envolve a programação. Pontos esses que discutimos neste trabalho e que nos permitiram compreender melhor como se dá esta prática._

## 🕒 [Generative design: a paradigm for design research](./Files/generative_design_a_paradigm_for_design_research__jon_mccormack.pdf) (Jon McCormack)

_Abstract: Generative design offers new modes of aesthetic experience based on the incorporation of system dynamics into the production of artifact and experience. In this paper, we review a number of processes that can be explored by designers and suggest how design as a discipline can benefit from this research. These processes include self-organization, swarm systems and ant colonies, evolution, and generative grammars. We give example applications of these processes to creativity and design._

## 🕒 [Modern Programming for Generative Design](./Files/modern_programming_for_generative_gesign__jose_lopes.pdf) (José Lopes)

_Resumo: Cada vez mais arquitectos transitam dos processos tradicionais e das codificações arquitecturais clássicas para uma nova área chamada Desenho Generativo. Desenho Generativo (DG) é a aplicação de métodos computacionais na geração de objectos arquitecturais. Nesta área, designers escrevem programas que quando executados produzem modelos geométricos. Este movimento é claramente visível no mundo acadêmico, com a adopção de cadeiras de programação no currículo de arquitectura, e no mundo da indústria, com estúdios de arquitectura a substituir processos tradicionais por aplicações de computador. Consequentemente, arquitectos e designers precisam desesperadamente de um sistema moderno para DG._

## 🕒 [Programming Languages for Generative design](./Files/programming_languages_for_generative_design__antonio_leitao.pdf) (António Leitão)

_Abstract: In this paper we compare visual and textual programming languages for generative design. We argue that, in the past, this comparison has been flawed and that it is now time to reconsider the potential of the textual programming paradigm but using modern programming languages and development environments specifically targeted to the generative design domain. We present VisualScheme as a prime example of such language and we compare it with the most used visual programming language in the generative design field._

## 🕒 [Generative Design a new stage in the design process](./Files/generative_design_a_new_stage_in_the_design_process__rita_fernandes.pdf) (Rita Fernandes)

_Abstract: Design processes are characterized by change. Unfortunately, CAD tools are currently being used just as a more efficient version of the traditional paper-based approach, an approach that does not help the designers at handling change, particularly for the exploration of different solutions or to adapt the design to evolving requirements._

_Recently, new approaches have been introduced in the design process, which are better tailored for handling change. Generative Design is one of them and can be defined as the creation of shapes determined by algorithms._

_This dissertation argues for one main point: integrating Generative Design as a new stage in the design process dramatically simplifies the handling of changes. In particular, we propose an algorithmic approach to design that overcomes the limitations of the traditional approach for using CAD tools._

_Our approach requires the formalization of the design intents, for which we use programming. This approach has an initial cost. However, we argue that this cost is highly rewarding when the designers need to handle change, by allowing them to explore many different alternatives, quickly and effortlessly._

_To evaluate the proposed approach we developed a three-dimensional model of a case study, a large and complex building, using a purely programming-based representation._

## 🕒 [Creative Coding - Programming for Personal Expression](./Files/creative_coding_programming_for_personal_expression__kafai_peppler.pdf) (Kafai Peppler)

_Abstract: Media Arts within primary and secondary education is a relatively new avenue of research. Within the context of the arts classroom, rarely is learning to program emphasized despite its importance for creative expression in a digital medium. We present outcomes from an extensive field study at a digital studio where youth accessed programming environments emphasizing graphic, music and video. Learning the language of creative coding is essential to expression in a digital medium — one with increasing importance for youth and society at large. Here, we argue that it’s not just in the viewing or playing of digital media but also in the constructive — or coding — experience through which connections to art can be established._

## 🕒 [What is Generative Art - Complexity Theory as a Context for Art Theory](./Files/what_is_generative_art_complexity_theory_as_a_context_for_art_theory__philip_galanter.pdf) (Philip Galanter)

_Abstract: In this paper an attempt is made to offer a definition of generative art that is inclusive and provides fertile ground for both technical and art theoretical development. First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm._

## 🕒 [Aesthetic Coding: Exploring Computational Culture Beyond Creative Coding](./Files/aesthetic_coding__winnie_soon.pdf) (Winnie Soon)

_Abstract: Learning to code has started to be part of the core strategy in educational curriculum, from primary school to higher education, especially in many developed countries that promote stem education, or at least coding is recognized as an important aspect of science and technology development. In the art and design-related disciplines, creative coding emphasizes code as an expressive material and embraces exploration and experimentation of code beyond functional applications._

## 🕒 [Art education in the post-digital era](./Files/art_education_in_the_post_digital_era__tomi_dufva.pdf) (Tomi Dufva)

_Abstract: This dissertation examines the questions and problematics of code and digitality brought forward by the post-digital era. In particular, it focuses on the role and the means art education has in awakening a critical understanding of the digital constructs in our society. Moreover, this dissertation proposes creative coding as an art educational method to gain a first-hand comprehension of digitality._

## 🕒 [Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics](./Files/artificial_evolution_for_computer_graphics__karl_sims.pdf) (Karl Sims)

_Abstract: This paper describes how evolutionary techniques of variation and selection can be used to create complex simulated structures, textures, and motions for use in computer graphics and animation. Interactive selection, based on visual perception of procedurally generated results, allows the user to direct simulated evolutions in preferred directions. Several examples using these methods have been implemented and are described. 3D plant structures are grown using fixed sets of genetic parameters. Images, solid textures, and animations are created using mutating symbolic lisp expressions. Genotypes consisting of symbolic expressions are presented as an attempt to surpass the limitations of fixed-length genotypes with predefined expression rules. It is proposed that artificial evolution has potential as a powerful tool for achieving flexible complexity with a minimum of user input and knowledge of details._

## 🕒 [Code Bending: A New Creative Coding Practice](./Files/code_bending_a_new_creative_coding_practice__ilias_bergstrom.pdf) (Ilias Bergstrom)

_Abstract: Creative coding, artistic creation through the medium of program instructions, is constantly gaining traction, a steady stream of new resources emerging to support it. The question of how creative coding is carried out however still deserves increased attention: in what ways may the act of program development be rendered conducive to artistic creativity? As one possible answer to this question, we here present and discuss a new creative coding practice, that of Code-Bending, alongside examples and considerations regarding its application._

## 🕒 [Coding as Creative-Aesthetical and Political Expression](./Files/coding_as_creative_aesthetical_and_political_expression__dan_verstandig.pdf) (Dan Verständig)

_Abstract: While the first computers were technological behemoths, the devices have evolved rapidly over the past few years, turning into smart objects in our homes, workplaces and even in our pockets in the shape of smartphones. Computers have evolved in their material appearance and their complexity, so has the computer code that is running on it._

## 🕒 [Concurrency for Creative Coding](./Files/concurrency_for_creative_coding__arnaud_loonstra.pdf) (Arnaud Loonstra)

_Abstract: Programming for multiple processors is a challenging task. Approaches to program concurrently require a thorough understanding of the computer. Not all people who program possess this. However, as processors are not getting faster, everybody will need to program concurrently eventually. Creative Coding is the practice of programming for being expressive. In this research we propose an easy framework for Creative Coders to program concurrently based on a paradigm of interacting entities. The proposed framework is tested on a group of Creative Coders. The research confirms that concurrent programming is very challenging, that concurrent programs require a different design and that users find it easier to program using the proposed framework._

## 🕒 [Creative Coding and Visual Portfolios for CS1](./Files/creative_coding_and_visual_portfolios_for_cs1__ira_greenberg.pdf) (Ira Greenberg)

_Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and development of a new approach to teaching the college-level introductory computing course (CS1) using the context of art and creative coding. Over the course of a semester, students create a portfolio of aesthetic visual designs that employ basic computing structures typically taught in traditional CS1 courses using the Processing programming language. The goal of this approach is to bring the excitement, creativity, and innovation fostered by the context of creative coding. We also present results from a comparative study involving two offerings of the new course at two different institutions. Additionally, we compare our results with another successful approach that uses personal robots to teach CS1._

## 🕒 [Creative Coding for All Students](./Files/creative_coding_for_all_students__mr_zargham.pdf) (M. R. Zargham)

_Abstract: This paper represents progress of our ongoing effort on new way of teaching an introductory programming course. Students use a simple environment, called Innovative Coding (IC), to write a code for designing a game or a virtual world. As they code, they see the development of their world in a 3D environment step by step. Once they have completed their design, they can wear a VR headset to interact on their design in a virtual environment. Currently, IC supports five different types of landscapes (desert, fantasy island, mountain, farm, and city), 8 different princesses, 8 boys with different ethnicities, 10 different animals, 10 different monsters, one helicopter, and one car. Excluding landscapes, all other objects are animated being able to perform many tasks, such as walk, run, jump, eat, sleep, dance, etc. IC also supports many static objects that are not animated, such as: tracks to construct different roller-coasters, plants, flowers, cabins, decorating objects, and walls._

## 🕒 [Creative Coding for Humor Design: A Preliminary Exploration](./Files/cretive_coding_for_humor_design__alessandro_valitutti.pdf) (Alessandro Valitutti)

_Abstract: Computational humor generation is a tricky problem. The idea to have a computer program capable of making people laugh, in a similar way today machines can beat them at chess, is intriguing. Unfortunately the prototypes built in the last decade do not seem to have exhibited humorous skills comparable to those of humans._

## 🕒 [Drawing With Code: The Experience of Teaching Creative Coding as a Skill for Communication Designers](./Files/drawing_with_code__a_benedetti.pdf) (A. Benedetti)

_Abstract: In this contribution we present a didactical framework aimed at teaching design students how to use coding in support to their design process. This framework has been developed during the last four years in a course named “Creative Coding”, held in the Communication Design degree of Politecnico di Milano. The article firstly introduces the motivations that support the idea of teaching coding to design students, it specifies the approach to coding that is taken into account (creative coding) and it describes the strategies and the framework developed for teaching it. Lastly it presents and discusses results derived from the held editions, showing how the presented framework is capable of making design students conversant about coding and able to use this skill within a communication design project, with a beneficial boost in creativity and a better understanding of the feasibility of their ideas._

## 🕒 [Engagement and Computational Thinking through Creative Coding](./Files/engagement_and_computational_thinking_through_creative_coding__dana_hoppe.pdf) (Dana Hoppe)

_Abstract: Rising enrollments in Computer Science pose an opportunity to engage students from diverse backgrounds and interests; and a challenge to deliver on positive learning outcomes. While student engagement is the driving factor for increased learning performance and retention, it has been declining to new lows for Computer Science students in recent years. In order to further explore the potential of contextualized computing as a tool for increasing engagement in computing and developing Computational Thinking aptitude in students, we have developed an introductory computing course contextualized with Art and Design with modules centered around guiding pedagogical principles and aimed at middle school and high school students. This Creative Coding course utilizes a principle and theory-based approach in its design in order to meet the pedagogical goals of this project. Additionally, we have developed data collection tools for analyzing the effectiveness of the course in increasing student engagement and Computational Thinking aptitude. Results coming from limited implementation at two sites suggests that with future implementation, data collection, and material refinement, Creative Coding can serve as a flexible tool for increasing student engagement and as a basis for further research into contextualized computing._

## 🕒 [Evolving Virtual Creatures](./Files/evolving_virtual_creatures__karl_sims.pdf) (Karl Sims)

_Abstract: This paper describes a novel system for creating virtual creatures that move and behave in simulated three-dimensional physical worlds. The morphologies of creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both generated automatically using genetic algorithms. Different fitness evaluation functions are used to direct simulated evolutions towards specific behaviors such as swimming, walking, jumping, and following. A genetic language is presented that uses nodes and connections as its primitive elements to represent directed graphs, which are used to describe both the morphology and the neural circuitry of these creatures. This genetic language defines a hyperspace containing an indefinite number of possible creatures with behaviors, and when it is searched using optimization techniques, a variety of successful and interesting locomotion strategies emerge, some of which would be difficult to invent or build by design._

## 🕒 [Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game "life"](./Files/mathematical_games__martin_gardner.pdf) (Martin Gardner)

_Abstract: Most of the work of John Horton Conway, a mathematician at Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge, has been in pure mathematics. For instance, in 1967 he discovered a new group --some call it "Conway's constellation"-- that includes all but two of the then known sporadic groups. (They are called "sporadic" because they fail to fit any classification scheme.) Is is a breakthrough that has had exciting repercussions in both group theory and number theory. It ties in closely with an earlier discovery by John Conway of an extremely dense packing of unit spheres in a space of 24 dimensions where each sphere touches 196,560 others. As Conway has remarked, "There is a lot of room up there."_

## 🕒 [Nature of Abstract Art](./Files/nature_of_abstract_art__meyer_schapiro.pdf) (Meyer Schapiro)

_Abstract: Before there was an art of abstract painting, it was already widely believed that the value of a picture was a matter of colors and shapes alone. Music and architecture were constantly held up to painters as examples of a pure art which did not have to imitate objects but derived its effects from elements peculiar to itself. But such ideas could not be readily accepted, since no one had yet seen a painting made up of colors and shapes, representing nothing. If pictures of the objects around us were often judged according to qualities of form alone, it was obvious that in doing so one was distorting or reducing the pictures; you could not arrive at these paintings simply by manipulating forms. And in so far as the objects to which these forms belonged were often particular individuals and places, real or mythical figures, bearing the evident marks of a time, the pretension that art was above history through the creative energy or personality of the artist was not entirely clear. In abstract art, however, the pretended autonomy and absoluteness of the aesthetic emerged in a concrete form. Here, finally, was an art of painting in which only aesthetic elements seem to be present._

## 🕒 [ShaderBase: A Processing Tool for Shaders in Computational Arts and Design](./Files/shader_base__andres_gomez.pdf) (Andrés Felipe Gómez)

_Abstract: We introduce a new software tool called ShaderBase that facilitates using, sharing, and curating GLSL shaders in computational design, interactive arts, and data visualization. This tool is part of the Processing programming environment, an open-source project widely used for teaching and production in the context of media arts and design. Shaders are a crucial component in the development of large-scale data visualizations, interactive installations, real-time rendering tools, videogames, virtual reality applications, etc. However, their use requires advanced shader programming skills, and the creation of new shader-based effects demands a deep understanding of the graphics pipeline in modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). ShaderBase uniquely addresses these issues by allowing Processing users to easily upload and share shaders via an underlying Git repository. ShaderBase operates in close integration with Processing’s interface, so that users can incorporate shaders into their programs with minimal effort. Furthermore, the shaders indexed in ShaderBase take advantage of Processing’s drawing API, and incentives the use of shaders among artists and designers who might not be able to do so otherwise._

## 🕒 [Shape Grammars: A Key Generative Design Algorithm](./Files/shape_grammars_a_key_generative_design_algorithm__ning_gu.pdf) (Ning Gu)

_Abstract: Shape grammars are one of the main generative design algorithms. The theories and practices of shape grammars have developed and evolved for over four decades and showed significant impact on design computation and contemporary architecture. The formal computational approach to generative design as specified in shape grammars, and the novel descriptions and applications of shapes and shape rules for representing and composing a design, has become the foundation and inspiration for many contemporary computational design methods and tools, especially parametric design, which is a current leading computational design method. This chapter gives an overview of the historical developments and applications of shape grammars. The algorithm is introduced by highlighting the background, key components, and procedures for design generation, methods, and issues for authoring shape grammars, shape grammar evolution and extension, purposes of shape grammar application, as well as implementation of shape grammars. The characteristics of shape grammars are presented and discussed by comparing them to other key generative design algorithms, some of which have been applied in conjunction with shape grammars. This chapter shows that shape grammars have significant potentials in design generation, analysis, and optimization, as seen in many of the grammar studies. The future directions should focus on further research, improved pedagogy, as well as validation in design practice, to further advance the field._

## 🕒 [The Problem with Evolutionary Art Is...](./Files/the_problem_of_evolutionary_art__philip_galanter.pdf) (Philip Galanter)

_Abstract: Computational evolutionary art has been an active practice for at least 20 years. Given the remarkable advances in that time in other realms of computing, including other forms of evolutionary computing, for many a vague feeling of disappointment surrounds evolutionary art. Aesthetic improvement in evolutionary art has been slow, and typically achieved in ways that are not widely generalizable or extensible. So what is the problem with evolutionary art? And, frankly, why isn’t it better? In this paper I respond to these questions from my point of view as a practicing artist applying both a technical and art theoretical understanding of evolutionary art. First the lack of robust fitness functions is considered with particular attention to the problem of computational aesthetic evaluation. Next the issue of genetic representation is discussed in the context of complexity and emergence. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the need for art theory around evolutionary and generative art is discussed, and a theory that stands typical evolutionary art on its head is proposed._
