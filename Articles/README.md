## üïí [As Linguagens de Programa√ß√£o para as Artes - Metodologias de Ensino-Aprendizagem Adaptadas (Madalena Ribeiro)](./Files/as_linguagens_de_programacao_para_as_artes__madalena_ribeiro.pdf)

_Resumo: Atualmente, as linguagens de programa√ß√£o s√£o usadas por pessoas com forma√ß√£o em dom√≠nios cada vez mais diversos e distintos do habitual, tendo j√° chegado ao dom√≠nio das artes. A linguagem Processing, que tem um cariz visual e que possibilita o desenvolvimento de aplica√ß√µes/performances com elementos visuais e sonoros, foi mesmo projetada para ser usada por artistas. Contudo, a prepara√ß√£o pr√©via e a sensibilidade do p√∫blico-alvo desta linguagem, enquanto aprendizes, √© bastante distinta da prepara√ß√£o dos alunos comuns de linguagem de programa√ß√£o. Por esse motivo, √© aqui proposto um conjunto de metodologias de ensino/aprendizagem adaptadas, no sentido de criar entusiasmo na aprendizagem e atingir um √™xito efetivo._

## üïí [Contextualizing Generative Design (Saeed Arida)](./Files/contextualizing_generative_design__saeed_arida.pdf)

_Abstract: Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch? How can we address contextual parameters without a loss?_

_Resumo: Atualmente, o uso de novas tecnologias influencia diretamente o processo de cria√ß√£o do designer. A programa√ß√£o √© uma destas ferramentas e vem sendo utilizada, por exemplo, em aplica√ß√µes do design que tem sido chamadas de Design Param√©trico e Design Generativo. Assim sendo, o objetivo desse trabalho √© realizar um estudo explorat√≥rio sobre a influ√™ncia da programa√ß√£o no processo de design e em sua linguagem visual. Para atingir esse objetivo, foi levantado um hist√≥rico desta pr√°tica, tra√ßado um panorama de projetos da atualidade e foram realizadas experimenta√ß√µes pr√°ticas que exploraram as possibilidades e potencialidades deste modo de fazer design na √°rea visual. Estas explora√ß√µes revelaram pontos importantes do processo de design que envolve a programa√ß√£o. Pontos esses que discutimos neste trabalho e que nos permitiram compreender melhor como se d√° esta pr√°tica._

## üïí [Generative design: a paradigm for design research (Jon McCormack)](./Files/generative_design_a_paradigm_for_design_research__jon_mccormack.pdf)

_Abstract: Generative design offers new modes of aesthetic experience based on the incorporation of system dynamics into the production of artifact and experience. In this paper, we review a number of processes that can be explored by designers and suggest how design as a discipline can benefit from this research. These processes include self-organization, swarm systems and ant colonies, evolution, and generative grammars. We give example applications of these processes to creativity and design._

## üïí [Modern Programming for Generative Design (Jos√© Lopes)](./Files/modern_programming_for_generative_gesign__jose_lopes.pdf)

_Resumo: Cada vez mais arquitectos transitam dos processos tradicionais e das codifica√ß√µes arquitecturais cl√°ssicas para uma nova √°rea chamada Desenho Generativo. Desenho Generativo (DG) √© a aplica√ß√£o de m√©todos computacionais na gera√ß√£o de objectos arquitecturais. Nesta √°rea, designers escrevem programas que quando executados produzem modelos geom√©tricos. Este movimento √© claramente vis√≠vel no mundo acad√™mico, com a adop√ß√£o de cadeiras de programa√ß√£o no curr√≠culo de arquitectura, e no mundo da ind√∫stria, com est√∫dios de arquitectura a substituir processos tradicionais por aplica√ß√µes de computador. Consequentemente, arquitectos e designers precisam desesperadamente de um sistema moderno para DG._

## üïí [Programming Languages for Generative design (Ant√≥nio Leit√£o)](./Files/programming_languages_for_generative_design__antonio_leitao.pdf)

_Abstract: In this paper we compare visual and textual programming languages for generative design. We argue that, in the past, this comparison has been flawed and that it is now time to reconsider the potential of the textual programming paradigm but using modern programming languages and development environments specifically targeted to the generative design domain. We present VisualScheme as a prime example of such language and we compare it with the most used visual programming language in the generative design field._

## üïí [Generative Design a new stage in the design process (Rita Fernandes)](./Files/generative_design_a_new_stage_in_the_design_process__rita_fernandes.pdf)

_Abstract: Design processes are characterized by change. Unfortunately, CAD tools are currently being used just as a more efficient version of the traditional paper-based approach, an approach that does not help the designers at handling change, particularly for the exploration of different solutions or to adapt the design to evolving requirements._

_Recently, new approaches have been introduced in the design process, which are better tailored for handling change. Generative Design is one of them and can be defined as the creation of shapes determined by algorithms._

_This dissertation argues for one main point: integrating Generative Design as a new stage in the design process dramatically simplifies the handling of changes. In particular, we propose an algorithmic approach to design that overcomes the limitations of the traditional approach for using CAD tools._

_Our approach requires the formalization of the design intents, for which we use programming. This approach has an initial cost. However, we argue that this cost is highly rewarding when the designers need to handle change, by allowing them to explore many different alternatives, quickly and effortlessly._

_To evaluate the proposed approach we developed a three-dimensional model of a case study, a large and complex building, using a purely programming-based representation._

_Abstract: Media Arts within primary and secondary education is a relatively new avenue of research. Within the context of the arts classroom, rarely is learning to program emphasized despite its importance for creative expression in a digital medium. We present outcomes from an extensive field study at a digital studio where youth accessed programming environments emphasizing graphic, music and video. Learning the language of creative coding is essential to expression in a digital medium ‚Äî one with increasing importance for youth and society at large. Here, we argue that it‚Äôs not just in the viewing or playing of digital media but also in the constructive ‚Äî or coding ‚Äî experience through which connections to art can be established._

## üïí [What is Generative Art - Complexity Theory as a Context for Art Theory (Philip Galanter)](./Files/what_is_generative_art_complexity_theory_as_a_context_for_art_theory__philip_galanter.pdf)

_In this paper an attempt is made to offer a definition of generative art that is inclusive and provides fertile ground for both technical and art theoretical development. First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm._
