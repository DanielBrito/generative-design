Hi Gary:

Here's some quick notes on the source code changes I made for the
Macintosh port.

1.  I used conditional compiles of the form

#if __dest_os == __mac_os
#else
#endif

since this is what Metrowerks CodeWarrior uses in their system header files.

2.  Only the following files were changed:

	assoc.c
	ca.c
	macplot.c (new)
	misc.h
	misc.c
	plot.c
	stutter.c

Scan for "MRM" in the source - this marks all changes I made.

3.  Mac details:

    assoc and ca needed changes to prevent printf output during
    plotting - I played with it but it was easiest to just take
    them out.
    
    stutter needed a strdup (believe it or not) and a fix to a
    macro.
    
    plot and macplot changed as would be expected; I wrote 2
    different init routines (for color or gray-scale Mac plotting
    devices, "Mac" or "mac"), and shared the other plot routines.
    
    misc.h and misc.c added some platform-specific stuff, including
    the console interface (one line of code, gotta love it), and the
    need to #include "string.h".

Hope this effort leads to widespread Mac CBN experimentation!

Mike
