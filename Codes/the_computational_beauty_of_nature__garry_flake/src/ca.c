/* NAME
 *   ca - simulate arbitrary one-dimensional cellular automata
 * NOTES
 *   The main portion of this code is relatively straight forward,
 *   whereas the code to compute lambda (or random rules of a
 *   specified lambda) is a bit tricky and is solved by a method
 *   that resembles dynamic programming.
 *   
 *   Also, the states are stored in a circular buffer such that
 *   the sums for every cell are computed as fast as possible with
 *   the number of additions on the order of two per cell.
 * MISCELLANY
 *   When supplying a lambda value for a random rule, it may not
 *   be possible to find a string with that lambda value because
 *   one may not exist.  In this case, the program will do its
 *   best to find one as close as possible.  In any event, the
 *   algorithm for finding random rules strings for a specified
 *   lambda value is non-deterministic and may not always find
 *   a perfect match even if one exists.  However, it will work
 *   well with high probability, and even when it doesn't find
 *   a perfect match it almost always gets close.
 * BUGS
 *   No sanity checks are performed to make sure that any of the
 *   options make sense.

Computes a one-dimensional cellular automata.  The evolution of the \
CA is determined by the number of states, the radius size, the initial \
state, and the supplied rule.  A rule is specified by a (states - 1) * \
(radius * 2 + 1) length string.  At each time step a sum of each cell \
plus all of its neighbors within the radius is computed.  That sum is \
used as an index into the rules string which determines the next step \
For example, with radius = 1 and states = 2 the rule \"0110\" specifies \
that sums of 0 and 3 map to the 0 state, and sums of 1 and 2 map to the \
1 state.  A negative init string randomly initializes the starting \
states. If the init string is \"-N\" then each cell has a 1 in N chance \
of being non-zero.\
