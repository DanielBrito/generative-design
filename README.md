# Research about algorithms that generate art

I discovered the term ***generative design*** by accident, when I was surfing on Instagram and I saw an amazing image that was created using this technique. Then, I started looking for articles, videos, and books, to learn more about it.

Nowadays, I carry with me an increasing appreciation for this field, since I also consider myself a visual artist.

Therefore, I would like to share some of the content that I've been finding for those who may be also interested in this intersection between visual arts and programming.
